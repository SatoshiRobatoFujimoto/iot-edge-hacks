Azure IoT Edge Tiny Hacks

At first, I will prepare Simulated Device Tiny Hacks.
This read the temperature data from files that include simple number of temperature degree instead of simulated data.You can prepare ACTUAL sensor data in this "Bridge File".

Note that, json file can control the "Bridge File" name definition. See sample json files.
Please replace "modules/simulated_device/src/simulated_device.c" to use.
